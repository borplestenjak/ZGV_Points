Numerical examples for Critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils

This repository contains numerical examples for the paper:  Bor Plestenjak, "On properties and numerical computation of critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils"
  
Matlab examples run in Matlab 2023a or higher. 

# Requirements

- Examples require that MultiParEig - is installed. You can download it from a Matlab File Central Exchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47844-multipareig). The examples were computed using Version 2.8.0.0.
- Some examples require that Advanpix MultiPrecision Toolbox (https://www.advanpix.com/) is installed. The examples were computed using Version 5.3.2.15744.

## Numerical experiments for synthetic data

To reproduce numerical results from the paper, run m-files Example1_Intro.m, ..., Example11_QEP.
